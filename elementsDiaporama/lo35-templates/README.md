# lo35-templates

A series of 25 presentation template layouts provided in version 3.5 of LibreOffice. They were located in the `/usr/lib/libreoffice/share/template/common/layout/` directory. They no longer appear to be available in recent versions of LibreOffice, having been replaced by ten much less useful templates (`AbstractGreen.otp`, `AbstractRed.otp`, `AbstractYellow.otp`, `BrightBlue.otp`, `DNA.otp`, `Inspiration.otp`, `LushGreen.otp`, `Metropolis.otp`, `Sunset.otp`, `Vintage.otp`).

Most of the templates were created by Ilko Hoepping, with others by Volker Ahrendt. These appear to be licensed under LGPLv3 along with the rest of LibreOffice v3.5.
