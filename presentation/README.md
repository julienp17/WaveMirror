# Presentations

This is an highschool project that will count in our final mark of engineering class for the French baccaulaur√©at.

The students are graded on their abilty to explain what they did on their part of the project, and how it was relevant. 

You'll find the common presentation which explains the goal of the project and displays engineering schematics, and every part's presentation. Please note that they are in French.
