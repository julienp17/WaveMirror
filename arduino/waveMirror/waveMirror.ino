 *  
 * The Arduino receive the grayscale values of a row from the Raspberry Pi,  
 * and then controls 10 servos to adjust their position based of these values.
 *
 * This program is the code of the first Arduino. Since we need 120 servos and each Arduino
 * controls 10 Servos, we need 12 Arduino in total. You can find the codes of the other
 * Arduino's at : https://github.com/julienp17/WaveMirror/tree/master/arduino/waveMirror
 * They're the same programm, only the SLAVE_ADDRESS changes.
 * 
 * Throughout this code, the Raspberry Pi, acting as 'Master' in the I2C communication 
 * between itself and the Arduino, will be refered to as RPi. 
 * You will notice a lot of newlines and comments on this code, intended to help 
 * readability and comprehension for beginners.
