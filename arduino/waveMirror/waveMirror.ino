/* 
 * This is the main Arduino program of the project. 
 * 
 * After receiving the grayscale values of a row from the Raspberry Pi by I2C,
 * we begin to turn each Servos at an angle based on these values.
 *  
 * Since we need 48 Servos and each Arduino controls 8 of them, we need 
 * 6 Arduino in total. All Arduinos must use this program, but make sure 
 * to change the SLAVE_ADDRESS.
 * 
 * The Serial port must be used for debugging and not monitoring, otherwise it
 * will take too much time and slow down the program. 
 *
 * You can find the schematics in this directory.
